As I worked for [Colorfy](https://colorfy.me/), my first employer, I had the chance to build the Solis App from the ground up using <Badges.ReactNative />, witnessed the go live of the app and maintained it for over two years.
The device was already usable using a web app but was limited in features and UX. This new mobile app was supposed to be the "remote" to the device.

### Challenges

- Working in IoT means you're always dependent on another system for the app to function, making testing much harder.
- This device was precisely about connecting to a Wi-Fi network and activating data to go online. That required the app to fully handle an offline mode, despite needing some network to log in/sign up and buy data packages. Since most of our users use the app while traveling, they can't be left without any internet in the middle of nowhere.
- We had no control over the backend, and it being built and hosted in China made it particularly unreliable and slow (we are talking 1-5s to resolve simple REST API calls from europe)

### Key Achievements

- Built the app from the ground up with React Native that helps set up and control the Solis device. Handling ~10-20k MAU.
- Handling of online/offline state.
- Implemented an in-app store withÂ [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/de), **bringing a new revenue stream to the company, handling thousands to tens of thousands of $ a day**.
- [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics) integration.
- Managed releases in the App Store and Play Store.
- Onboarding of interns and other engineers in the project.
