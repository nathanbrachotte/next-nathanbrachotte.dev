A React Native podcast app that intelligently skips content segments users aren't interested in during playback.

## Features

- Dynamic content filtering with automatic segment skipping
- Seamless playback continuation across app states
- Native audio processing for background operation

## Technical Challenges

- **Background Processing**: Native modules handle skip logic when React Native JS thread is inactive
- **Metadata Integration**: Embedding skip segment data into initial playback configuration
- **Cross-Platform Audio**: Consistent behavior across iOS and Android native audio systems

## Architecture

- Use Itunes' API to get the podcast metadata
- Use podcast's RSS feed to download the episodes
- React Native frontend with TypeScript
- Native iOS/Android modules for background audio processing
- Client-side skip logic to avoid content modification
