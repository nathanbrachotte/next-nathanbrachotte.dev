Gîte La Randonnée is a vacation rental property website built for my parents' rental business. The website showcases the property located in Les Fourgs, Doubs, France, which can accommodate up to 14 guests and offers a fully equipped kitchen, multiple bedrooms, a garden with outdoor seating, and proximity to various outdoor activities like skiing and hiking.

## Project Overview

This project was built to provide a modern, user-friendly platform for potential guests to explore the rental property, view amenities, and easily get in touch for bookings and inquiries.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring the website looks great on all devices
- **Contact Form**: Integrated contact form for guest inquiries and booking requests
- **Property Showcase**: Beautiful presentation of the property's features and amenities
- **SEO Optimized**: Built with Astro for optimal performance and search engine visibility

## Technical Implementation

Built with <Badges.Astro /> and <Badges.React />, the website leverages Astro's static site generation capabilities for fast loading times and excellent performance. The React components provide interactive elements like the contact form while maintaining the benefits of a static site.

## Design & Development

I was responsible for the complete design and user interface, creating an intuitive and visually appealing experience that reflects the welcoming nature of the rental property. The contact form was custom-built to handle guest inquiries efficiently.
