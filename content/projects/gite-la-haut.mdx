Gîte La-Haut is a vacation rental property website built as a sibling site to Gîte La Randonnée, designed to showcase and promote my parents' new rental house. Built with the same modern technology stack, this website provides a consistent experience while highlighting the unique features of this new property.

## Project Overview

This project was built to provide a modern, user-friendly platform for potential guests to explore the new rental property, view amenities, and easily get in touch for bookings and inquiries. As a sibling site to Gîte La Randonnée, it maintains design consistency while showcasing the distinct character of this new property.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring the website looks great on all devices
- **Contact Form**: Integrated contact form for guest inquiries and booking requests
- **Property Showcase**: Beautiful presentation of the property's features and amenities
- **SEO Optimized**: Built with Astro for optimal performance and search engine visibility
- **Consistent Branding**: Maintains design language from the sibling site while establishing its own identity

## Technical Implementation

Built with <Badges.Astro /> and <Badges.React />, the website leverages Astro's static site generation capabilities for fast loading times and excellent performance. The React components provide interactive elements like the contact form while maintaining the benefits of a static site. The architecture mirrors Gîte La Randonnée for consistency and maintainability.

## Design & Development

I was responsible for the complete design and user interface, creating an intuitive and visually appealing experience that reflects the welcoming nature of the rental property. The contact form was custom-built to handle guest inquiries efficiently, and the design maintains visual consistency with the sibling site while highlighting the unique aspects of this new property.
