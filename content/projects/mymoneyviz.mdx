Finally see your entire net worth in one place. Track stocks, crypto, real estate, bonds, private shares—13+ asset types—with beautiful charts that show your wealth evolution over time.

## The Problem

Most people have their wealth scattered across multiple accounts: stocks in Trade Republic, crypto in Binance, cash in various banks, maybe some real estate. They have no clear picture of their total net worth, and tracking everything in a spreadsheet is tedious and never gets done.

## The Solution

MyMoneyViz gives you a complete view of your financial life in one dashboard. No bank connections required—just add your assets once, update monthly with a quick refresh, and watch your wealth story unfold through beautiful visualizations.

## Key Features

**Track Any Asset**  
Stocks, crypto, real estate, cash, bonds, private shares—if it has value, you can track it. 13+ asset types supported with custom categories for anything else.

**Beautiful Visualizations**  
Net worth curves, allocation breakdowns, historical trends. See your wealth evolution over time with clear, interactive charts that make complex financial data instantly understandable.

**Backfill Your History**  
Add past snapshots so your graph doesn't jump from $0 to $150k. Import historical data to see your full wealth journey and understand how you got where you are.

**Set Goals & Track Progress**  
Define your target net worth and watch your progress automatically. Overlay target trajectory vs actual growth to spot gaps between intent and reality.

**Analyze Your Portfolio**  
Get insights into portfolio health, risk exposure, and diversification. Understand your allocation across asset classes, geographies, and investment styles.

**Coming Soon: AI-Powered Updates**

**Coming Soon: True Net Worth**  
Track mortgages, loans, credit cards, and tax liabilities alongside your assets. See payoff progress, projected debt-free dates, and your real financial picture.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple way to answer "What's my net worth?" without connecting my bank accounts or paying for expensive financial software. I needed something between a messy spreadsheet and enterprise portfolio management—a tool that respects privacy, works with any asset type, and makes wealth tracking feel effortless.

## Technical Highlights

Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Shadcn UI for a fast, modern experience. Type-safe database operations with Kysely. Interactive charts with Recharts. Guided onboarding flow that gets users tracking in under 3 minutes. Privacy-first architecture with no bank connections—users stay in complete control of their data.
