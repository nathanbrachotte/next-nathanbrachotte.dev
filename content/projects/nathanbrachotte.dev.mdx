The goal was to give me a platform to share the things I do, the projects I've worked on, the blog posts or videos I appear in, or the endorsements I've received from my peers during my career.
I've designed the website and my logo to play with the pink/blue duality, with different shades of each.

### Challenge

My goal was to keep the website clean and tidy while also interactive. That's why most elements move or reach to mouse hover to reach this "touch and feel" sensation.
It also needed to be fully responsive and handle many different data structures.
My top priorities were:

- Design a recognizable logo that stands out.
- Build a website that stands out by its colorful scheme while remaining easily browsable.
- Good SEO and instant loading times.

I found a template website using¬†<Badges.Gatsby />, linked by <Badges.Contentful /> CMS, to host the data. <Badges.Contentful /> allows me to update assets and content on the fly. I'm hosting the website on Netlify and using [Webhooks](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/guides/what-are-webhooks-how-they-work#what-is-a-webhook); therefore, it is automatically built and deployed on each change from the <Badges.Github /> repo or CMS.
I've built the website using¬†<Badges.StyledComponents />¬†and¬†[rebass](https://rebassjs.org), which provides a set of primitive components from which you can iterate. I was happy to try <Badges.StyledComponents /> as it is pretty popular in the industry. I found it to be powerful yet very lengthy when you want to write a fully responsive and complex website. It makes the number of components you write proliferate.
Therefore, I've started migrating to¬†<Badges.Tailwind />. It is a total blast to use, super-efficient in how much CSS is sent to the browser and helps keep the code much more colocated.

### Feature Highlights

- My own brand, my own color scheme üòÅ.
- Animations for a "lively" feeling.
- I can update assets and texts and trigger a new version on the fly by changing data in Contentful.
- It gives a good overview of all the things I do.
