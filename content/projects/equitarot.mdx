Equitarot is a French Tarot multiplayer application with an unlimited subscription model, positioned as an ethical alternative to freemium competitors. The product targets the **eastern France market** (Alsace, Lorraine, Franche-Comté, Burgundy regions) where traditional card game culture remains strong.

## Product Vision

**Tagline**: "Equitarot - Jouez au tarot en ligne en illimité. Sans Pub. Sans Micro-transactions."

The subscription-based model without microtransactions represents a **major ethical competitive advantage** in a market dominated by aggressive freemium models. Unlike competitors using "pay-to-win" models or constantly pushing in-app purchases, Equitarot positions itself as the ethical alternative where all players have equal chances, regardless of budget.

## Current Status: Smoke Test Phase

This project is currently operating as a **smoke test** to validate product-market fit and measure demand before full product development.

### Smoke Test Strategy

The primary objective is to:

1. **Drive traffic to the landing page** - Test SEO effectiveness and messaging resonance
2. **Capture signup intent** - Direct users to a fake signup/payment page
3. **Collect contact information** - When users attempt to sign up or subscribe, display a message indicating we'll be in touch
4. **Measure conversion rates** - Track how many visitors show purchase intent (click through to signup/payment)
5. **Validate demand** - Assess market interest before investing in full product development

### Implementation Details

- **Fake Signup/Payment Flow**: Users who click "Essayer Gratuitement" or attempt to subscribe will be directed to a signup/payment page
- **Contact Collection**: Instead of processing actual payments, the system will:
  - Collect user contact information (email, name, etc.)
  - Display a message: "Merci pour votre intérêt ! Nous vous contacterons bientôt pour vous informer du lancement d'Equitarot."
  - Store leads for future outreach
- **Analytics Focus**: Track key metrics including landing page visits, click-through rate to signup/payment, form submission rate, geographic distribution (especially eastern France), and engagement metrics

## Core Value Proposition

### Strategic Positioning: Fair Play as Core Value

The product positioning articulates around three differentiation pillars:

**1. Fair and Transparent Gaming** - Unlike competitors using "pay-to-win" models or constantly pushing in-app purchases, position the application as the ethical alternative where all players have equal chances, regardless of budget.

**2. Uninterrupted Experience** - Free tarot applications are criticized for intrusive advertisements, while the subscription model offers a pure, uninterrupted experience.

**3. Predictable Value** - A fixed subscription for unlimited play strongly contrasts with freemium models where costs can accumulate unpredictably.

## Target Market

**Primary Market: Eastern France**

- **Geographic Focus**: Alsace, Lorraine, Franche-Comté, Burgundy regions
- **Demographics**: Traditional card game enthusiasts, players seeking authentic gaming experiences
- **Market Characteristics**: Strong cultural connection to traditional French card games, preference for fair play and transparent pricing

### Family Safety Focus

Position Equitarot as the **only ethical platform that won't try to sell ads or microtransactions** to users or their family members. This is particularly important for the 30-50 year old market segment who want to protect elderly relatives from malicious ads, microtransactions, and suspicious app installations.

## Marketing Strategy

### Key Messages

1. **"Jeu illimité, prix limité"** - Emphasize predictability vs. uncontrolled freemium spending
2. **"Tous égaux à la table"** - No paid advantages, pure skill
3. **"Sans interruption, comme le tarot traditionnel"** - Connection with game authenticity
4. **"Abonnement transparent, zéro surprise"** - Contrast with hidden freemium fees
5. **"Jouez autant que vous voulez"** - Total freedom vs. token rationing

### SEO Strategy

Targeting ethical long-tail keywords that capitalize on searches from users frustrated by freemium models:

- "tarot français sans publicité"
- "jeu tarot abonnement illimité"
- "tarot en ligne sans microtransactions"
- "application tarot équitable"
- "jeu tarot éthique sans pay-to-win"

## Monetization Model

### Subscription Tiers

- **Monthly Subscription**: Fixed monthly fee for unlimited access
- **Annual Subscription**: Discounted annual option
- **Free Trial**: Limited-time trial period to demonstrate value
- **No Freemium Elements**: Complete absence of token systems, energy systems, or pay-to-win mechanics

### Pricing Strategy

- Transparent, fixed pricing
- No hidden fees or surprise charges
- Clear value proposition vs. freemium alternatives
- Competitive positioning against premium competitors

## Success Criteria

The smoke test will be considered successful if:

- Sufficient traffic is generated through SEO efforts
- Conversion rate (visitors → signup intent) meets target threshold
- Strong interest from eastern France market is demonstrated
- Positive feedback on messaging and value proposition

This approach allows validation of the product concept, pricing strategy, and market demand with minimal development investment before committing to full product build.
