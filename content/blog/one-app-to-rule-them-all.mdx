Recently, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) has been making waves as a sleek, modern alternative to traditional app launchers like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
While many users download it simply to open apps, they often overlook its full capabilities.
Raycast can significantly reduce the number of applications you have running:

- Clipboard & snippet manager (replacing apps like [PasteApp](https://pasteapp.io/))
- Window management tool (replacing apps like [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/))
- Emoji picker (replacing apps like [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/))
- App launcher hotkeys (replacing apps like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) & Spotlight)
- Translation tool (using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) API)
- Password manager (using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) API)

## Setting it Up

1. First, you need to take a look at their [landing page](https://www.raycast.com/) because hot damn üòç
1. Optionally, consider [replacing Spotlight](https://manual.raycast.com/hotkey) completely to use `‚åò + Space` instead of `‚å• + Space`.

   />

## Clipboard & Snippet Manager

1. [Set a hotkey](https://manual.raycast.com/command-aliases-and-hotkeys) to instantly access your clipboard history.

   <Image

     src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/hotkey.webp"
     priority
     width={2300}
     height={1600}
   />

   You can now summon your clipboard history with one shortcut (I use `Shift + ‚åò + X`).

   <Image
     alt="Clipboard history"
     src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/clipboard-history.webp"
     priority
     width={1800}
     height={1248}
   />

1. Learn the shortcuts: paste directly with `Enter` or copy to the clipboard with `‚åò + Enter` to paste normally later. Press `‚åò + K` to view all actions available for an item.

1. Optionally, pin your important or frequently used text.

     alt="Pin text"
     src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/pin.webp"
     priority
     width={1800}
     height={1248}
   />

1. For other texts you want to keep but not always show at the top of the clipboard history, save them as snippets:

   <Image
     alt="Save as snippet"
     src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/save-as-snippet.webp"
     width={1800}
     height={1248}
   />

## Snippets

[Snippets](https://manual.raycast.com/snippets) are incredibly useful as they allow you to dynamically load information and set shortcuts to trigger them.
For instance, I use them to easily paste a JWT into my GraphQL console:

1. Type "Create snippets" in the search bar.
1. Write snippets and use [dynamic placeholders](https://manual.raycast.com/dynamic-placeholders), like this:

   <Image
     alt="Dynamic snippet example"
     src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/snippet.webp"
     width={672}
     height={471}
   />

   (I always prefix all my snippets with `r:`.)

Now, by simply typing `r:auth`, it instantly writes `{ Authorization: "Bearer eydsadsa.."}` with the prefilled JWT.

## Window Management

Raycast also offers impressive [window management](https://manual.raycast.com/window-management) commands out of the box.
You only have to add your (Rectangle) shortcuts into the `Window management` settings (type `Window` then `‚¨Ü + ‚åò + ,`).

<Image
  alt="Window management settings"
  src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/window-management.webp"
  width={2300}
  height={1600}
/>

You only need to set the `Left Half` and `Right Half` shortcuts to also get the `1/3` and `2/3` window positions when repeating the shortcut.
You can choose whether to maintain this behavior in the `Cycling` section on the right.

## App Launcher Shortcuts

This feature also comes built-in. You can assign hotkeys to launch your most used apps (type the name of your app and then `‚¨Ü + ‚åò + ,`).

  src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/warp.webp"

I use `‚å• + letter` for launching apps.

## Translations

This feature is a bit trickier to setup but allows for instant translations of small text snippets.

  priority

  height={1700}

1. Get a [DeepL API key](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api)
1. Go to Raycast store by typing `Store`
1. Install the `Deepcast` extension
   <Image
     alt={`Snippet`}
     src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/deepl.webp`}
     width={1800}
     height={1248}
   />
1. Enter your API key in the extension settings.

     width={2300}
     height={1600}
   />
1. You can now translate any selected text by typing `tr` and then chosing the language you want to translate to.

## Password manager

<Callout emoji="üí°" type="info">
  This workflow will roughly be equivalent for most password managers. If you
  don't use Bitwarden, expect somewhat similar steps for 1Password or LastPass.
</Callout>
1. Search for "Bitwarden" in the store and install it.

    <Image
      alt="Bitwarden store page"
      src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/bitwarden-store.webp"
      width={1800}
      height={1248}
    />

1. Then go to your Bitwarden account's settings and retrieve your API keys.

   <Image

     src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/bitwarden-keys.webp"
     priority
     width={2640}
     height={1994}
   />

1. On the first run, you will be prompted to enter the keys, and once done, you can access your vault by typing "bit".

     width={1800}
     height={1248}
   />

You now have access to your vault just as you would with the desktop app ü•≥

## Emoji Picker

1. Search for "emoji"
1. Add a hotkey to be able to instantly open the panel

  src="/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/emojis-store.webp"

  height={1448}

1. You can now search for emojis by using the hotkey (`‚å• + E` in my case) and typing the name of the emoji
