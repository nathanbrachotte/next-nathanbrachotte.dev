Everyone's heard of [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), it's an app launcher √† la Alfred.
What most people don't know is that it can actually do a lot more and really reduce the amount of apps you have running:

- Clipboard & snippet manager (like [PasteApp](https://pasteapp.io/))
- Window management tool (like [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/))
- Translations (like [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/))
- App launcher hotkeys (like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) does)
- Password manager (like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/))

## Setting it up

1. First, you need to take a look at their [landing page](https://www.raycast.com/) because hot damn üòç
1. Install it
1. (Optional) You can even decide to [replace spotlight](https://manual.raycast.com/hotkey) completly to use `‚åò + Space` instead of `‚å• + Space`
   <Image
     alt={`Spotlight replacement`}
     src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/settings.webp`}
     priority
     width={672}
     height={471}
   />

## Clipboard & snippet manager

1.  [Set a hotkey](https://manual.raycast.com/command-aliases-and-hotkeys) to instantly see the clipboard history

    <Image
      alt={`Spotlight replacement`}
      src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/hotkey.webp`}
      priority
      width={672}
      height={471}
    />

    You can now bring up your clipboard history in one shortcut (I use `Shift + ‚åò + X`)

    <Image
      alt={`Spotlight replacement`}
      src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/clipboard-history.webp`}
      priority
      width={672}
      height={471}
    />

1.  Familiarize yourself with the shortcuts, you can either paste directly (`Enter`) or copy to the clipboard with (`‚åò + Enter`) and then only paste normally later on.
    To see all possible actions on an item, you can hit `‚åò + K`.

1.  (Optional) Pin your important/recurrent text

    <Image
      alt={`Spotlight replacement`}
      src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/pin.webp`}
      priority
      width={672}
      height={471}
    />

1.  (Optional) For the other texts you want to keep, but not always show on top of the clipboard history, you can set them as snippets:
    <Image
      alt={`Spotlight replacement`}
      src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/save-as-snippet.webp`}
      width={672}
      height={471}
    />

## Snippets

[Snippets](https://manual.raycast.com/snippets) are really useful as you can dynamically load extra information and set shortcuts to trigger them.
For example, I use them to easily paste a JWT in my GraphQL console:

1. Type `Create snippets` in the search bar
1. Write snippets and make use of [dynamic placeholder](https://manual.raycast.com/dynamic-placeholders), in this

   <Image
     alt={`Snippet`}
     src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/snippet.webp`}
     width={672}
     height={471}
   />
   (I always prefix all my snippets with `r:`)

Now all I need to do is to type `r:auth` and it will instantly write `{ Authorization: "Bearer eydsadsa.."}` with the prefilled JWT.

## Window management

Surprisingly, Raycast also offers pretty damn good [window management](https://manual.raycast.com/window-management) commands out of the box.
The only thing I had to do was setting my Rectangle shortcuts into the `Window management` settings (type `Window` then `‚¨Ü + ‚åò + ,`).

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/window-management.webp`}
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

You only have to set the `Left Half` and `Right Half` shortcuts to also get the `1/3` and `2/3` windows positions when repeating the shortcut. You can decide if you want to keep this behavior in the `Cycling` section on the right.

## App launcher shortcuts

This also comes out of the box, you can set your favorite apps to launch with a hotkey (type the name of your app and then `‚¨Ü + ‚åò + ,`).

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/warp.webp`}
  priority
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

I use (`‚å• + letter`) to launch apps.

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/hotkeys.webp`}
  priority
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

## Translations

This one is a little trickier but allows me to get instant translations on small text snippets.

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/translate2.gif`}
  priority
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

1. Get a [DeepL API key](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api)
1. Go to Raycast store by typing `Store`
1. Install the `Deepcast` extension
   <Image
     alt={`Snippet`}
     src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/deepl.webp`}
     priority
     width={672}
     height={471}
   />
1. Set your API key in the extension settings
   <Image
     alt={`Snippet`}
     src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/deepl-api-key.webp`}
     priority
     width={672}
     height={471}
   />
1. You can now translate any selected text by typing `tr` and then chosing the language you want to translate to.

## Password manager

<Callout emoji="üí°" type="info">
  This workflow will roughly be equivalent for most password managers, if you
  don't use Bitwarden, expect somewhat similar steps.
</Callout>

Search the `Bitwarden` in the store and install it.

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/bitwarden-store.webp`}
  priority
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

Then go to your Bitwarden account's settings and get your API keys.

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/bitwarden-keys.webp`}
  priority
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

On the first run, you will be asked to enter the keys, once you have done that, you can access your vault by typing `bit`.

<Image
  alt={`Snippet`}
  src={`/images/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all/bitwarden-access.webp`}
  priority
  width={672}
  height={471}
/>

You know have access to your vault like you would with their desktop app ü•≥

## Conclusion

Hopefully this helped you get rid of some apps running in the background of your computer and made you gain some speed in your workflow!
