## Software

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

  A beautiful terminal that allows you to save and share your terminal sessions. I don't use many of its features. + [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) (the desktop version)

  Unlike Postman and Insomnia, you don't have to login and thy aren't trying to upsell you.
  But the export function is missing ü§Æ so nowadays I'd suggest to simply use [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)

- [Postico 2](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

  Much nicer than all the other know SQL clients (TablePlus is a good alternative too).

### Productivity

- **Apple Notes**

  Tried them all. Notion, Obsidian.. Apple Notes just works. And it can be really powerful if you make heavy use of smart folders and tags and navigation links.
  Only thing missing is Markdown support which you can get with...

- [Pronotes](https://www.pronotes.app/)
  This software adds all Markdown shortcuts to Apple Notes. And it's free.

- [Screen Studio](https://www.screen.studio/)

  I use it to record tutorials and presentations for the teams I work with.

- [Freedom](https://freedom.to/)

  Changed my life, I have a session that blocks all social media and apps from 8am to 6pm. And again from 11pm on. Cured my brain for the attention economy.

- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)

  I use it to take pretty screenshots, fast edits and record videos.

- [Clop](https://lowtechguys.com/clop/)

  It automatically optimizes the screenshot I take and has a nice drop area for optimizing any image or video.

- [Sukha ‚ùå](https://www.thesukha.co/app)

  Got a one year subscription a while ago but they only added gimmick features in the last years so I'm not renewing it. I'd recommend using Freedom instead.

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

  Literally my favorite app in the world. I could not live without it anymore.
  It powers my entire workflow, launch apps, search, bookmarks, clipboard history, hotkeys, plugins, etc.
  I use the Pro version with advanced AI so it's also my AI assistant.

  - See [One app to rule them all](https://www.nathanbrachotte.dev/blog/one-app-to-rule-them-all)

- [ScriptKit](https://www.raycast.com/)

  I mostly use it for my blog to automate the process of dealing with images. Gotta find more use cases for it.
