## End-to-end Type Safety for the REST of us

In modern web development, using <Badges.TypeScript /> efficiently is not just a luxury, it's a requirement to build robust, maintainable applications.
With types comes a great DX and it's always easier to build great products when you're not always having to deal with the mental load of a poor DX.

You may have heard of tools like [GraphQL Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) or [trpc](https://trpc.io/).
Both allow you to generate TypeScript types from your backend, so they can be used on your frontend.

- You either use the <Badges.GraphQL /> schema as a source (GraphQL checks at runtime that the types sent and returned correspond to the schema),
- or you own the backend and can use <Badges.Trpc /> for your REST endpoints (trpc also does runtime data validation in and out).

But sometimes, you have to deal with 3rd party APIs, or you have a legacy REST API that you simply cannot change.
In these cases, you will end up having to write types on your frontend, i.e., to **assume what the type of the parameters and of the response are** and hope for the best.

BUT, here comes the good news: If the API you're working with has a [Swagger (OpenAPI)](https://swagger.io/specification/) definition, **you actually can generate types from it! 🎉**

Let's explore together how the REST of us can also enjoy a great DX.

## Generating types

### API

Assuming we want to consume an API that gives use exchange rates from a base
currency with a GET endpoint:

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/typesafety-for-the-rest-of-us/get.png`}
  width={1538}
  height={1946}
/>

### Adding openapi-typescript to your project

In a TS project, let's install the [openapi-typescript](https://openapi-ts.pages.dev/)
package `npm i -D openapi-typescript@next`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can also dig into the [example
  code](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nextjs-openapi-example) by yourself.
</Callout>

You can now run `npx openapi-typescript 
$YOUR_API_FILE_OR_URL -o ./openApi.ts` to generate the types.

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/typesafety-for-the-rest-of-us/openApi.png`}
  width={1086}
  height={202}
/>

By pointing this command at a swagger.json file, whether it resides
in your repo or behind a URL, you're able to generate a <Badges.TypeScript />
file (called here `openApi.ts`) containing types that
mirror your API's structure.

## Fetch data with the generated types

### Using openapi-fetch

We can now very simply consume this API with the types with `openapi-fetch` ([docs](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)). It uses `axios` under the hood.

`npm i openapi-fetch`

We just have to create a client instance that will take the `paths` type as a generic:

```typescript
import createClient from 'openapi-fetch'
import type { paths } from '../openApi'

const { GET } = createClient<paths>({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com/v1/',
})
```

and we then get super nice autocompletion when we want to fetch data, and a the returned data is also typed:

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/typesafety-for-the-rest-of-us/autocomplete2.gif`}
  width={1996}
  height={1080}
/>

## A custom alternative

Now you might be wondering "What if I want to use [tanstack-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)?"
or "Will this work for both client and service side components in <Badges.Next /> ?

I found that it's actually not that hard to build you custom client implementation based on the types.
(I used another article as a starter for this implementation
but couldn't find it anymore so I could not link it here,
if you do find this article feel free to reach out 😄)

You can use this custom function, called `apiCall` in the [repo](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nextjs-openapi-example/blob/main/src/customApiCall.ts).
To use it, let's first install our client of choice (in my case [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)) and
[query-string](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string): `npm add axios query-string`

Then, you simply can copy/paste the file into your project and use it like so:

```typescript
import { apiCall } from './apiCall'
import { paths } from './openApi'

const exchangeRate = await apiCall('/currency/exchangerate', 'get', {
  base: 'USD',
})
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  One difference to note, in this case we don't return an `error` object when
  something goes wrong, but instead throw an error as we want `react-query` or
  [Next.js server side error
  handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling)
  to take care of the error.
</Callout>
The same way that `openapi-fetch` does, we have a fully typed response, but we now
own the code, so we can customise it.

### Auth with Next.js

For example, if you want to pass a JWT in your headers when fetching data from
both client and server components, the way you provide the token will be different.

So we can also add a custom parameter that will take a function that returns
the token, and simply pass a different function based on which side of the web we are in:

```typescript /getToken/#b
const path = '/currency/exchangerate'

// Client side
export const useGetExchangeRate = () => {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [path],
    queryFn: async () =>
      apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
        query: {
          base: 'EUR',
        },
      }),
  })
}

// Server side
export async function getExchangeRate() {
  const { getToken } = auth()

  return await apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
    query: {
      base: 'EUR',
    },
  })
}
```

As simple as that. Ez.

### "Yes yes, but.. I still have to create types to pass the correct values to these two functions"

Well.. no quite. There actually are a couple of helpers that you can build that will help with that:

```typescript /ExchangeRateQuery/#g {21, 35}
const path = '/currency/exchangerate'

type ExchangeRateQuery = RequestParams<typeof path, 'get'>['query']['base']

// Client side
export const useGetExchangeRate = (baseCurrency: ExchangeRateQuery) => {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [path],
    queryFn: async () =>
      apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
        query: {
          base: baseCurrency,
        },
      }),
  })
}

// Usage in client-side components
const { data: exchangeRate } = useGetExchangeRate('EUR')

// Server side
export async function getExchangeRate(baseCurrency: ExchangeRateQuery) {
  const { getToken } = auth()

  return await apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
    query: {
      base: baseCurrency,
    },
  })
}

// Usage in server-side components
const exchangeRate = await getExchangeRate('EUR')
```

Or maybe you want to extract the type of the response because you need to pass it down to another component via a prop:

```typescript {3}
export interface SubComponentProps {
  // You probably want to abstract this type to `openApiTypes.ts` as you might need it in several places
  exchangeRate: ResponseType<'/currency/exchangerate', 'get'>
}

export const SubComponent = ({
  exchangeRate: { base, date, rates },
}: SubComponentProps) => {
  return ...
}
```

All of these helper types are available in [openApiTypes.ts](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nextjs-openapi-example/blob/main/src/openApiTypes.ts).
Each of them allow you to extract some info about the query:

- `ResponseType` will give you the expected return type
- `RequestParams` will give you all the expected parameters to pass in the query and path
- `PathParams` will only give you the path params (`/users/:userId` will give you `{ userId: string }`)
- `RequestBody` will give you the type of the expected body in `POST/PUT/PATCH` methods

The beauty in this solution is that you **only ever rely on generated types**,
that means when the backend changes, you'll immediately know that it did, and what code to change in your frontend.

We are getting pretty damn close to great DX in REST aren't we? 😎

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  One thing to remember. **You should only rely on swaggers you trust**. Unlike
  trpc and GraphQL, this solution only gives you types, it doesn't ensure
  runtime validation of the data you receive. If the endpoints you're are
  targeting are notoriously unstable, I'd advise you use
  [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to also validate the data at runtime.
