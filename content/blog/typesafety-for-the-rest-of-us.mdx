## End-to-end Type Safety for the REST of us

In modern web development, using <Badges.TypeScript /> efficiently is not just a luxury, it's a requirement to modern apps.
With well-written types come a great DX, and great DX allows for building (and maintaining) great products fast.
One main issue, though, is that we have to write these types, and dealing with the mental load of writing types in addition to business logic can slow us down hard.

To solve that problem, you may have heard of tools like [GraphQL Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) or [trpc](https://trpc.io/).
Both allow us to automatically generate TypeScript types from the backend, so they can be used on the frontend.

- In the case of <Badges.GraphQL />, we use the schema as a source (GraphQL checks at runtime that the types sent and returned correspond to the schema),
- And by using <Badges.Trpc />, we directly build fully-typed REST endpoints (trpc also does runtime data validation in and out).

But sometimes, we have to deal with 3rd party APIs, or a legacy REST API that we cannot easily change.
In these cases, we will end up having to write types on the frontend, i.e., to **assume what the type of the parameters and of the response are** and hope for the best.

BUT here comes the good news: If the API we're working with has a [Swagger (OpenAPI)](https://swagger.io/specification/) definition, **we actually can generate types from it! 🎉**

Let's explore together how the REST of us can also enjoy a great DX.

## Generating types

### API

Assuming we want to consume an API that gives us exchange rates from a base
currency with a GET endpoint:

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/typesafety-for-the-rest-of-us/get.png`}
  priority
  width={1538}
  height={1946}
/>

### Adding openapi-typescript to your project

In a TS project, let's install the [openapi-typescript](https://openapi-ts.pages.dev/)
package `npm i -D openapi-typescript@next`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can also dig into the [example
  code](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nextjs-openapi-example) by yourself.
</Callout>

We can now run `npx openapi-typescript 
$YOUR_API_FILE_OR_URL -o ./openApi.ts` to generate the types.

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/typesafety-for-the-rest-of-us/openApi.png`}
  priority
  width={1086}
  height={202}
/>

By pointing this command at a swagger.json file, whether it resides
in the same repo or behind a URL, we're able to generate a <Badges.TypeScript />
file (called here `openApi.ts`) containing types that
mirror your API's structure.

## Fetch data with the generated types

### Using openapi-fetch

We can now very simply consume this API with the types with `openapi-fetch` ([docs](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)). It uses `axios` under the hood.

`npm i openapi-fetch`

We just have to create a client instance that will take the `paths` type as a generic:

```typescript
import createClient from 'openapi-fetch'
import type { paths } from '../openApi'

const { GET } = createClient<paths>({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com/v1/',
})
```

and we then get super nice autocompletion when we want to fetch data, and a the returned data is also typed:

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/typesafety-for-the-rest-of-us/autocomplete3.webp`}
  priority
  width={1054}
  height={1080}
/>

## A custom alternative

Now you might be wondering "What if I want to use [tanstack-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)?"
or "Will this work for both client and service side components in <Badges.Next /> ?

I found that it's actually not that hard to build a custom client implementation based on the types.

We can use this custom function, called `apiCall` in the [repo](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nextjs-openapi-example/blob/main/src/customApiCall.ts).
To use it, let's first install our client of choice ([axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)) and
[query-string](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string): `npm add axios query-string`

Then, simply copy/paste the file into your project and use it like so:

```typescript
import { apiCall } from './apiCall'
import { paths } from './openApi'

const exchangeRate = await apiCall('/currency/exchangerate', 'get', {
  base: 'USD',
})
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  One difference to note, in this case we don't return an `error` object when
  something goes wrong, but instead throw an error as we want `react-query` or
  [Next.js server side error
  handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling)(or
  any other framework's) to take care of the error.
</Callout>
The same way that `openapi-fetch` does, we have a fully typed response, but we now
own the code, so we can customise it.

### Example Auth

For example, we may want to pass a JWT in our headers. But in most modern frameworks (Next.js, Remix, etc)
we either are running the code in the browser, or on a server.
Therefore, the way we provide the token might differ based on the platform.

To solve this, we can add a custom parameter that will take a function that returns
the token, and simply pass a different function based on which side of the web we are in:

```typescript /getToken/#b
const path = '/currency/exchangerate'

// Client side
export const useGetExchangeRate = () => {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [path],
    queryFn: async () =>
      apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
        query: {
          base: 'EUR',
        },
      }),
  })
}

// Server side
export async function getExchangeRate() {
  const { getToken } = auth()

  return await apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
    query: {
      base: 'EUR',
    },
  })
}
```

As simple as that. Ez.

### "Yes yes, but.. I still have to create types to pass the correct values to these two functions"

Well.. not quite. There actually are a couple of helpers that we can use that will help with that:

```typescript /ExchangeRateQuery/#g {21, 35}
const path = '/currency/exchangerate'

type ExchangeRateQuery = RequestParams<typeof path, 'get'>['query']['base']

// Client side
export const useGetExchangeRate = (baseCurrency: ExchangeRateQuery) => {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [path],
    queryFn: async () =>
      apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
        query: {
          base: baseCurrency,
        },
      }),
  })
}

// Usage in client-side components
const { data: exchangeRate } = useGetExchangeRate('EUR')

// Server side
export async function getExchangeRate(baseCurrency: ExchangeRateQuery) {
  const { getToken } = auth()

  return await apiCall(getToken, path, 'get', {
    query: {
      base: baseCurrency,
    },
  })
}

// Usage on the server (Next.js RSC for example)
const exchangeRate = await getExchangeRate('EUR')
```

Also, maybe we want to extract the type of the response because we need to pass it down to another React component via a prop:

```typescript {3}
export interface SubComponentProps {
  // You probably want to abstract this type to `openApiTypes.ts` as you might need it in several places
  exchangeRate: ResponseType<'/currency/exchangerate', 'get'>
}

export const SubComponent = ({
  exchangeRate: { base, date, rates },
}: SubComponentProps) => {
  return ...
}
```

All of these helper types are available in [openApiTypes.ts](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nextjs-openapi-example/blob/main/src/openApiTypes.ts).
Each of them allow us to extract some info about the query:

- `ResponseType` will give the expected return type
- `RequestParams` will give all the expected parameters to pass in the query and path
- `PathParams` will only give the path params (`/users/:userId` will give you `{ userId: string }`)
- `RequestBody` will give the type of the expected body in `POST/PUT/PATCH` methods

The beauty in this solution is that we **only ever rely on generated types**,
that means when the backend changes, and we update our generated types, we'll immediately know what changed simply by checking our types.

We are getting pretty damn close to great DX in REST aren't we? 😎

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  One thing to remember. **You should only rely on swaggers you trust**. Unlike
  trpc and GraphQL, this solution only gives you types, it doesn't ensure
  runtime validation of the data you receive. If the endpoints you're are
  targeting are notoriously unstable, I'd advise you use
  [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to also validate the data at runtime.
