This list will be updated as I discover new tools or replace old ones.

## Software

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

  A beautiful terminal that allows you to save and share your terminal sessions. I don't use many of its features. + [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) (the desktop version)

  Unlike Postman and Insomnia, you don't have to login and thy aren't trying to upsell you.

- [DevBox](https://www.dev-box.app/)

  I bought it a while ago but don't think it's worth it for what it does.

- [Postico 2](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

  Much nicer than all the other know SQL clients (TablePlus is a good alternative too).

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

  I use it everyday

### Productivity

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

  I use it sometimes a lot and sometimes not, but I make heavy use of tags to keep everything somewhat organized. (I only sync on my phone using iCloud and that takes foreveeeer but at least it's free)

- [Screen Studio](https://www.screen.studio/)

  I use it to record tutorials and presentations for the teams I work with.

- [Freedom](https://freedom.to/)

  Changed my life, I have a session that blocks all social media and apps from 8am to 6pm. And again from 11pm on. Cured my brain for the attention economy.

- [Sukha ‚ùå](https://www.thesukha.co/app)

  Got a one year subscription a while ago but they only added gimmick features in the last years so I'm not renewing it. I'd recommend using Freedom instead.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

  I use it for personal stuff but I only when Obsidian is lacking in some way.

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

  I use it for clipboard history and to quickly open apps. Also have a bunch of plugins for instant translations with DeepL and talk to GPT.

- [ScriptKit](https://www.raycast.com/)

  I mostly use it for my blog to automate the process of dealing with images. Gotta find more use cases for it.
