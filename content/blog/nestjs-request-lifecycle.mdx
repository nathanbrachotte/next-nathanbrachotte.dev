## Introduction

Understanding the execution order of code when dealing with a <Badges.Nest /> backend can be quite challenging. Its reliance on a class-based structure, coupled with the extensive use of decorators, often makes it difficult to track the flow of code execution.

This article aims to demystify the components involved in a request lifecycle and the order in which they run. I'm hoping that after this deep dive, you will have gained actionable insights on how to debug your code and choose the right component for your use case.

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  A good understanding of decorators, Modules and Controllers is recommended to
  fully understand this deep dive. For a refresher, check out [this introductory
  video by
  NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZfO4EopfPA&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g8YFseGdkyj9RH9kVs_cMr&index=2).
</Callout>

Let's start with a basic <Badges.Nest /> app:

```ts
// app.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}

// app.controller.ts
@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get('/og')
  async getFirstUserName(): Promise<string> {
    return await this.appService.getFirstUserName()
  }
}

// app.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  async getFirstUserName() {
    return 'John Doe'
  }
}
```

## Middlewares

[Middlewares](https://docs.nestjs.com/middleware) are also common in <Badges.Express />. They intercept requests and have access to `request` and `context`. You can trigger the next middleware using `next()`.

<Callout emoji="📑" type="info">
  You can find the source code for the whole article
  [here](https://github.com/nathanbrachotte/nestjs-example/tree/part-2-request-lifecycle/src).
</Callout>

Now let's say we want to add, for all our routes, some logic that logs what route is being hit and which `user-agent` is used to send the request (to send this to our analytics). It'll look like this:

```ts title="logger.middleware.ts" caption=""
import { Injectable, NestMiddleware, Logger } from '@nestjs/common'
// Assuming you're using express, don't forget to add @types/express to your project
import type { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'

@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(LoggerMiddleware.name)

  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    // We only log the user agent to keep it simple.
    this.logger.debug(
      `Middleware -- Received request from agent ${req.headers['user-agent']}`,
    )

    next()
  }
}
```

Now let's add the Middleware to our `AppModule`:

```ts {9,11}
@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    // For all routes
    consumer.apply(LoggerMiddleware).forRoutes('*')
    // OR to target a single controller:
    consumer.apply(LoggerMiddleware).forRoutes(AppController)
  }
}
```

<Callout emoji="💡" type="info">
  You can get your Middlewares to [exclude
  routes](https://docs.nestjs.com/middleware#excluding-routes) and [target
  specific routes](https://docs.nestjs.com/middleware#route-wildcards).
</Callout>

Now, what's cool is that at every request our server processes, we're going to see the following:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/middleware-1-cut.png`}
  priority
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

Middlewares are pretty effective if you want to simply modify the `request` object, but they don't integrate really well with Controllers and Services. Thankfully we've got a few more tools available in our toolbox.

## Guards

[Guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) are also Middlewares, but they have some extra capabilities.

- They can be added at the app, Module, Controller, or route levels.
- They implement a `canActivate` method that is ran at each request it handles and throws a `ForbiddenError` if it returns `false`. Otherwise, it goes to the next Middleware (equivalent to call `next()`).
- They generaly are used to handle authentication and authorization for specific Modules or routes.

Let's take [the guard example](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards#authorization-guard) from the doc and implement it in our app (and fix the types):

```ts
import {
  Injectable,
  CanActivate,
  ExecutionContext,
  Logger,
} from '@nestjs/common'
import { Observable } from 'rxjs'
import { Request } from 'express'

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  guardLevel: string

  constructor(private level: string) {
    this.guardLevel = level
  }

  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    // Added typesafety by typing the request as `getRequest` returns `any` otherwise
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest<Request>()

    Logger.debug(`Guard ${this.guardLevel} -- Verifying cookie`)
    const cookie = request.headers.cookie

    return !!cookie
  }
}
```

For simplicity's sake, we will only check if a `cookie` header is present and throw an error otherwise.

We also added a way to log the context in which the Guard is being executed, this is useful because we can add the Guard at different levels in the app:

```ts {4,5,14-20,28,29,33,34}
// main.ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  // Here, we add the Guard at the global level after creating the app
  app.useGlobalGuards(new AuthGuard('main'))
  await app.listen(3000)
}

// app.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
  // Here, we add the Guard aft the module level
  {
    provide: APP_GUARD,
    useFactory: () => {
      return new AuthGuard('app module');
    },
  }
})
export class AppModule {
  // ...
}

// app.controller.ts
@Controller()
// Here we add the Guard to a specific controller
@UseGuards(new AuthGuard('controller'))
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  // And here we add the Guard to a specific route
  @UseGuards(new AuthGuard('route'))
  @Get('/og')
  async getOG(): Promise<string> {
    // ...
  }
}
```

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  The code in this article is for demo purpose only. It doesn't make sense to
  use the same Guard at different levels. If a whole Module is protected by a
  Guard, you don't need it at the Controller or route level. But you may have
  other Guards at these levels in a production app, hence the importance to know
  in which order they are called.
</Callout>

Now, let's send a first request without the header and see what happens:

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error response`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/guard-response-1.png`}
  width={908}
  height={520}
/>

Nice. We got a `ForbiddenError` as expected. Now the logs:

<Image
  alt={`Forbidden error logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/guard-1-cut.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>
Nice, we can see here the `Guard` instance declared in `main.ts` is the one that
threw an error. We can also see the `Guard` is executed **after** the `Middleware`.

Now, let's add the header and see what happens:

<Image
  alt={`Successful Guard request`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/guard-2-request.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

<Image
  alt={`Successful Guard logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/guard-2.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

The different instances of `AuthGuard` got triggered one after the other: `app module`, `main`, `controller` and then `route`.
If you think about it, it feels natural that the control flow goes from `global -> controller -> route`.

**From the highest/global level to the most specific one.**

One interesting thing to note, though, is that the `app module` instance we declared at the Module level, **is triggered before the `main` instance, declared at app level.**

This is briefly explained in the [request lifecyle doc](https://ru-nestjs-docs.netlify.app/faq/request-lifecycle#guard):

> If you are using app.useGlobalGuard() or providing the component via a module,
> it is globally bound. Otherwise, it is bound to a controller if the decorator
> precedes a controller class, or to a route if the decorator proceeds a route
> declaration.

**That means that both `app.useGlobalGuard()` and `@UseGuards()` do the same thing. We should consider them at the same level and not rely on one being triggered before the other.**

So far, we end up with the following request lifecycle:

<Image
  alt={`Request lifecycle with guards`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/guard-exca.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

## Interceptors

Interceptors are a way to run some business logic **before and after** the route business logic execution.

It can, for example, be used to log how long your business logic took to run or to implement a caching mechanism on some of your routes.

Let's add an interceptor that will the time it takes for requests to be resolved by our app. This could be useful for tracking performance issues:

```ts title="logger.interceptor.ts"
export class LoggerInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(LoggerInterceptor.name)
  private instanceLevel: string

  constructor(private level: string) {
    this.instanceLevel = level
  }

  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, handler: CallHandler) {
    // Everything here happens before the route business logic is executed
    const date = new Date()
    this.logger.debug(
      `LoggerInterceptor ${this.instanceLevel} -- Request count started.`,
    )

    // handle.handle() is the route business logic execution
    return handler.handle().pipe(
      tap(() => {
        // Everything here happens after the route business logic is executed
        const totalTime = new Date().getTime() - date.getTime()

        this.logger.debug(
          `LoggerInterceptor ${this.instanceLevel} -- Request completed in: ${totalTime} ms`,
        )
      }),
    )
  }
}
```

Implementation details aren't very relevant here, but know we are using [rxjs's](https://rxjs.dev/) `tap` operator to run some code after the route business logic has been executed. [NestJS doc on Interceptor](https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors).

Now let's add this `Interceptor` to our app, just like `Guards`, can be added at many levels:

```ts {5,12-17,26,31, 34}
// main.ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  // ...
  app.useGlobalInterceptors(new LoggerInterceptor('main'));
  await app.listen(3000)
}

// app.module.ts
@Module({
  // ...
  {
    provide: APP_INTERCEPTOR,
    useFactory: () => {
      return new LoggerInterceptor('app module');
    },
  }
})
export class AppModule {
  // ...
}

// app.controller.ts
@Controller()
// ...
@UseInterceptors(new LoggerInterceptor('controller'))
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  // ...
  @UseInterceptors(new LoggerInterceptor('route'))
  @Get('/og')
  async getOG(): Promise<string> {
    console.log("Running business logic")
  }
}
```

Now, let's send a request:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/interceptor-1-alt.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

Hmm, this is getting VERY interesting 👀

1. `Interceptor` follows the same `global -> controller -> route` pattern
1. `Interceptor` is always triggered **after** the `Guard`, no matter the level. The route-level `Guard` runs **before** the global `Interceptor`.

It makes sense that all global-level components would be triggered before any Controller or route-level component, but that's not the case.

So we now have the following request lifecycle:

<Image
  alt={`Interceptor lifecycle`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/interceptor-exca.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

## Pipes

Pipes are used in <Badges.Nest />'s way to validate and transform data before it reaches the route business logic. They can help validate the request body, query params, headers, etc. We won't dive into the Pipe topic too much as it can be quite hairy, but you can read more about it [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/pipes).
Let's consider a use case where we want our request to have a `body` containing a `name` field with a string of 2 to 10 characters.

We first create a custom Pipe that does the same as the `ValidationPipe` from NestJS, but with extra logs:

```ts {11-13, 16, 18-21} title="customValidationPipe.pipe.ts" caption="This is pseudo-code. You can check the real implementation in the source code."
@Injectable()
export class CustomValidationPipe implements PipeTransform {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(CustomValidationPipe.name)
  private instanceLevel: string

  constructor(private level: string) {
    this.instanceLevel = level
  }

  async transform(value: any) {
    this.logger.debug(
      `CustomValidationPipe ${this.instanceLevel} -- Validating`,
    )

    // ...
    const errors = validate(value)

    if (errors.length > 0) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed')
    }
    return value
  }
  // ...
}
```

And let's add this pipe to our app:

```ts {5,12-17,26,33,34,37}
// main.ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  // ...
  app.useGlobalPipes(new CustomValidationPipe('main'));
  await app.listen(3000)
}

// app.module.ts
@Module({
  // ...
  {
    provide: APP_PIPE,
    useFactory: () => {
      return new CustomValidationPipe('app module');
    },
  },
})
export class AppModule {
  // ...
}

// app.controller.ts
@Controller()
// ...
@UsePipes(new CustomValidationPipe('controller'))
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  // ...
  @Get('/og')
  async getOGByName(
    // This is how you validate the query params
    @Query(new CustomValidationPipe('route')) query: OgQueryDto,
  ): Promise<string> {
    Logger.log('Returning: ' + query.name);
    return query.name;
  }
}
```

Now let's send a request again, with a bad query param first:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/pipe-1-request.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

Cool. Like the others, the global `Pipe` at the module level threw an error. Now, let's send a request that will succeed:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/pipe-2-request.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>
<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/pipe-2.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>
From the logs, we can see that once again:

1. The Pipes are running all after
   `Guards` and `Interceptors`
1. The global `Pipe` is running **after** the
   route-level `Interceptor`

That gives us now the following:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/pipe-exca.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

## Exception filters

Continuing our exploration of <Badges.Nest />, let's discuss another critical component: Exception Filters. Like Middleware, Guards, Pipes, and Interceptors, Exception Filters play a crucial role in the request lifecycle. They are the safety net of your application, catching unhandled exceptions that occur while processing a request.

This is especially useful for:

- Customizing the response sent back when an exception occurs (a correlation ID, for example).
- Logging detailed error information for debugging purposes.
- Implementing a consistent error response structure across your application.
- Removing sensible information from the error response before sending it back to the client.

In our example, we will use it to catch deprecated routes and send back the new route that should be used.

```ts {}  title="deprecatedEndpoint.filter.ts"
export class DeprecatedEndpointException extends Error {
  constructor(
    public override message: string,
    public alternativeEndpoint: string,
  ) {
    super(message)
  }
}

@Catch(DeprecatedEndpointException)
export class DeprecatedEndpointFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  private readonly instanceLevel: string
  private readonly logger = new Logger(DeprecatedEndpointFilter.name)

  constructor(private level: string) {
    this.instanceLevel = level
  }

  catch(exception: DeprecatedEndpointException, host: ArgumentsHost): void {
    this.logger.debug(
      `Filter ${this.instanceLevel} -- Found a deprecated route`,
    )

    const ctx = host.switchToHttp()
    const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>()

    response
      .status(HttpStatus.GONE)
      .header('X-Deprecated-Message', exception.message)
      .header(
        'X-Deprecated-Alternative-Endpoint',
        exception.alternativeEndpoint,
      )
      .json({
        message: 'This endpoint is deprecated.',
      })
  }
}
```

Now, we add the filter to the app. At this point, you know the drill:

```ts {5,12-17,26,33,34,37}
// main.ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  // ...
  app.useGlobalFilters(new DeprecatedEndpointFilter('main'));
  await app.listen(3000)
}

// app.module.ts
@Module({
  // ...
  {
    provide: APP_FILTER,
    useFactory: () => {
      return new DeprecatedEndpointFilter('app module');
    },
  },,
})
export class AppModule {
  // ...
}

// app.controller.ts
@Controller()
// ...
@UseFilters(new DeprecatedEndpointFilter('controller'))
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  // ...
  @UseFilters(new DeprecatedEndpointFilter('route'))
  @Get('/og')
  async getOGByName(...): Promise<string> {
    throw new DeprecatedEndpointException(
      'This endpoint was removed because we all know John Wick is the real OG',
      '/john-wick',
    );
  }
}
```

Let's give this a shot:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/filter-1-request.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>
Nice! Now, let's look at the log. This Filter is only triggered once and a response
is sent back to the client. We can't really see the order in which they are called,
but only the one triggered is... wait, what? 🤔
<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/filter-1.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

Here is something new! In the case of errors, **the `route` instance is the first one called!**

If you think about how error boundaries are handled in <Badges.JavaScript />, it makes sense. **The first instance to catch the error is the one closest to the error itself.**

But that means that `Filters` are one of the only components not triggered in the `global -> Controller -> route` order but rather in the `route -> Controller -> global` order.
Just to be sure, here are the logs after I remove the `route` level filter:

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/filter-2.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>
And after I remove the `controller` level filter:
<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/filter-3.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

In conclusion, we now have the following request lifecycle (getting crowded out there):

<Image
  alt={`Middleware logs`}
  src={`/images/blog/nestjs-request-lifecycle/filter-exca.png`}
  width={1991}
  height={762}
/>

## Conclusion

This deep dive aimed at showing how much more complex than it seems the <Badges.Nest /> request lifecycle is. It will help you choose the suitable component based on your requirements in the future and also help you debug issues you may have on code execution order.

Main learnings:

- Components are run one after the other no matter their scope: `Middlewares` -> `Guards` -> `Interceptors` -> `Pipes`.
- `Filters` only run when an error is thrown.
- Each component is running in the following order: `global -> controller -> route.`
  - For `Filters`, the one closest to the error is the one that is triggered.
