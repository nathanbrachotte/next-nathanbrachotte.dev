## CPP - My framework to be the best team in the team

### Be candid

- Share your honest thoughts and motivations
- Show your struggles, even to your superiors and reports

### Be Proactive

- Challenge the status quo
- Openly address issues
- Try to learn something new every day

### Be Pragmatic, not dogmatic

- Don't just follow a solution just because of past experiences or because some other engineer said so
- Always try to find the balance between engineering and business priorities
  - Understand and communicate that addressing debt that hurts productivity also has a (hidden) business impact.

## How I mentor "junior-heavy" teams

TODO: Add pragmatic engineer post

Excerpt:

#### Coding

- Pair less experienced engineers with more experienced ones
- Supportive code reviews. Encourage not just offline ones, but talking code over
- Mob programming exercises
- Review their code, and work and give (supportive) feedback
- Where do they need the most support to grow? Can you help?
  - With direct feedback
  - With mentoring yourself
  - With connecting them with mentors
  - With pairing (and letting them drive)
- This is where having been a senior engineer can be really helpful

#### Engineering practices

- Discuss what "quality" means on the team, and document them
  Definition of Done on a feature. Discuss, document, follow.
- Complete relevant courses on technology used
  - Summarize learnings

#### Getting things done

- Expose them to the business
  - Product manager / designer / data scientist collaborating directly with people
  - Share business goals, updates
  - Team and org-wide demos
- Start small
  - Give smaller, better defined tasks to them. This might mean cutting scope, and doing
    more pre-work (for you, the manager, and the PM)

#### Mistakes, outages, bugs

- Expect them, and embrace them. Do NOT create a culture of fear

#### Expectations

- Career ladder: define what their level looks like, and what the next level is
- Competencies: define the dimensions on which they are evaluated (e.g. coding, architecture,
  execution etc)
- Current situation: figure out (with them where they are. Make a plan to close the most pressing gaps)

#### Be realistic

- It will take time to grow
- Progress will be slower
- Set expectations upwards, and hold your back for the team
- Can you bring in seniors externally (e.g. contractors) for the sake of mentoring? Try it!
- Do celebrate progress and wins. One step at a time!
