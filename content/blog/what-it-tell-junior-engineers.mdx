## What the best engineers do

- the best engineers lift others up
- The bad engineers make you feel small
  - They use complicated words
- They are easy to understand and so is their code
- They can explain themselves in simple terms and are happy to answer questions

  - They make sure people don't feel bad for asking (looks like stupid ) questions

- you should always ask questions if you don’t understand even if it makes you feel dumb
  - Truth is you’re getting smarter faster and most people don’t dare to do it

## Conqueer your fears

- You shouldn’t be afraid of learning new things
  - If you're not scared every now and then you’re not learning
- You should embrace and face the fear you feel when facing something hard and unknown
- Worst engineers I know know one tech well and are scared to touch anything else
  - Same, they only know one way to do things and are scared to try new ways
- you should always be candid about your feeling And how things are going in your team and how you feel you’re doing, even if you feel you’re not doing well

- you will never know everything so you should learn to research and solve problems and not specific solutions

- you’ll never lose money by changing company
- You have nothing to lose by applying to new jobs
- You should always openly discuss your salary with your teammates

## Learn to talk about money

- Recruiters will lie to you to get you in a company
  - Every company hiring is "growing" and the "team is so good" and whatnot

## You just need one
