      `Nathan was the first hire I made when I took over the software team at colorfy
and I got the chance to work with him starting from an internship in February
of 2018. At the time he was joining a small team of 3 developers and took over
a challenging and important IoT project as a React Native developer. His deep
care and feeling of responsibility for his work paired with him being an
excellent team player enabled him to deliver critical contributions right from
the start.`,
      `In the end of 2018 he finished his studies of Software and System Engineering
with High Honours and became an even more important member of the team
in his new role of a full time React Native developer. Nathan is a quick learner
and during the growth of the team to 7 members right now he never stopped
being vocal about his ideas on processes and more importantly was also
candid when we were deriving from our standards.`,
      `It was a pleasure being a part of his development from an intern to an
intermediate developer. Nathan is constantly learning new technologies and
frameworks within the React Native world but is also working on other
technologies in his spare time which shows his commitment to software
development in general.`,
